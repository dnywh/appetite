                    Arriving at Inua mid-morning, the elevator that lifts guests from the restaurant's entrance to the
                    dining room
                    is dense with the smell of smoke. Not the sharp-smelling smoke that makes you want to reach for the
                    emergency
                    button, but the soft, reassuring type that smells of forests and mushrooms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “We keep the smoker going 24/7,” says Thomas Frebel, Inua’s German-born head chef, as we approach
                    the
                    vertical smoker inside the service kitchen. The top shelf is lined with coral-like formations of
                    maitake
                    mushrooms; they’re a deep, dark shade of brown from five days of aging, compressing in rice koji
                    oil,
                    then three days of smoking. Thomas tells us that they’re then braised in a dashi stock of spruce
                    pine
                    needles from Hokkaido, and served topped with dried sakura petals.

                <p>
                    “Our approach to creating is to celebrate and highlight things we believe are unique to Japan,
                    existing
                    only here – or at least, in a different way. It’s not about the fatty piece of tuna or the A5 wagyu
                    meat.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2015, Copenhagen’s Noma restaurant came to Tokyo for a five-week residency at the Mandarin
                    Oriental,
                    at which time Thomas was a 10-year Noma veteran. Hypnotized by Japanese ingredients and food
                    culture,
                    Thomas set his sights on a permanent project in Tokyo, opening Inua in 2018. The restaurant’s name
                    comes
                    from the Inuit mythology of Greenland, where an Inua is a spirit that connects all living beings
                    with
                    nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Our biggest inspiration and biggest guidance is nature, staying connected to our surroundings, to
                    the
                    local ingredients, to the local traditions, to the local people. We celebrate those ingredients,
                    those
                    seasons, traditions, and techniques through the eyes of a stranger,” says Thomas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inua’s research and procurement teams connect with a network of around 150 farmers and producers
                    across
                    Japan. Their job, Thomas says, is to not just source ingredients, but to see what is happening
                    around
                    the ingredients, “to understand the culture and the country better, in order to distill these
                    experiences onto the plate.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we walk through the weave of kitchens, stairwells, smokers, and refrigerators, to end up at the
                    test
                    kitchen, Thomas shows some of the ingredients he’s most excited about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ingredients are like letters of a country and a landscape, which in the end, create an alphabet,”
                    he
                    says.“Many different ingredients create an alphabet, and an alphabet creates a language. So in the
                    end,
                    as humans, we are here to help a landscape speak.”

                <h2>Okinawa</h2>
                <h2 lang="ja">沖縄</h2>

                <h3>The diversity in Japan’s ecosystems.</h3>

                <p>
                    “Okinawa is the perfect example of a tropical climate,” says Thomas. “It’s so different from the
                    rest of
                    Japan – it could almost be somewhere else in the world because of its climate.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Canistel, or egg fruit, is a tropical fruit native to South America and cultivated in parts of Asia,
                    including Okinawa. They have an unusual custard-like flesh, like the lovechild of a pumpkin and an
                    avocado. “We discovered these two years ago, but we couldn’t figure out what to do with them. Now, I
                    think we’ve found our way.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Inua, canistel are fried in tempura batter, and served with a paste of shiku (Japanese bergamot),
                    rhubarb oil, roasted yeast, and kelp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We’re also trying to make miso with it, as it has a high-protein content and is low in fat, which
                    is
                    very good for miso,” says Thomas.
